## Quick start

1. Click the extension icon to enable recording on the current tab.
2. Interact with the page; steps appear in the panel.
3. Use **Copy** to copy the scenario or save it locally.

## Troubleshooting

- **Incognito**: enable “Allow in incognito” on the extension details page.
- **Iframes/popups**: make sure the page allows script injection; if host permissions are restricted, add your domain.
- **Nothing recorded**: confirm you clicked the extension icon (user-initiated) and the page finished loading.

## Permissions explained

`activeTab` (user-initiated access), `scripting` (observe DOM events), `storage` (local scenarios), `clipboardWrite` (copy), `tabs` (status/URL only), optional restricted `host_permissions` for specific domains.
